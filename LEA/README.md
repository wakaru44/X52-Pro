# LEA Touchscreen companion

A profile to use with LEA, to use a touchscreen (a mobile phone or a table)
as an extra panel with buttons and macros.

This is just an example, coming from the LEA guys themselves, that I'm hoping
to re-work into something more useful with my version of the controls.

So focused more on high level functions (like chase = ( full engines, no systems, boot all the time) )
or rarely used things, like "silent running", "night vision", "jettison cargo" and stuff like that.


## How to use this

PPK is the binary format of LEA projects.

Simply install LEA on your PC, go to the project manager, and import it.
